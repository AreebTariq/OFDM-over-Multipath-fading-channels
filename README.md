This project covers the conceptual and experimental side of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Various parameters associated with OFDM are explained in a theoretical and mathematical way. OFDM without channel, with AWGN channel, and with Rayleigh multipath fading is simulated to experiment with numerous scenarios and observe communication and Bit Error Rate (BER) behaviors. For each experiment, the design parameters, their calculation, Simulink block diagram, MATLAB code, and results with explanation are mentioned in this project. For experiments, the WiFi 802.11 OFDM parameters are followed. Different Modulations for a given channel condition are compared. Also, other channels for a given modulation are evaluated. Various physical phenomena related to wireless communication are simulated as well.
